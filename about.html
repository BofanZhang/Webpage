  <h2>
    Brief Summary of The Timeline of The Atomic
    Model
  </h2>
  <p class="white">
    <span class="bold">Dalton's Theory:</span> In
    Dalton's theory of the atomic level, he stated
    that all elements are indestructable spheres.
    He did not have any evidence to back his claim
    up. However when conducting a experiement he
    discovered that matter cannot be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p class="white">
    <span class="bold">Thomson's Theory:</span> In
    Thomson's theory, he discovered that there are
    subatomic particals called electrons. He knew
    that all atoms are neutral from Dalton's
    theory, however when he was experiementing he
    discovered that there was something affecting
    a sheet of metal that caused it to bend
    towards a magnet that was positive. Thus he
    discovered the electron. (It's Very Brief). He
    later added changes to Dalton's model by
    adding electrons inside these indestructable
    spheres
  </p>
  <p class="white">
    <span class="bold">Rutherford's Model:</span>
    In Rutherford's model of the atomic model he
    completley changed what was accepted back
    then. In his model of the atom, he discovered
    that there was a nucleaus in the center of the
    atom. The way he discovered it was by shoot
    charged alpha particals at a peice of gold.
    When he shot the gold with the alpha
    particals, he discovered that some particles
    bounced back at him but majority passed right
    through. (He used a sheet of phosphorous to
    detect the partcles that bounced back) With
    experiement he discovered that there is a
    nucleaus in the center of the atom and that
    there is alot of empty space between the
    nucleus and the eletrons. With this discovery,
    he created a planetary model of the atom. In
    this model, the nucleus was in the center,
    like the sun with electrons orbiting it, just
    like how we orbit the sun.
  </p>
  <p class="white">
    <span class="bold">Bohr's Atomic Model</span>
    Bohr's atomic model it quite simillar to
    Rutherford's model. However instead of
    uncontrolled orbits, Bohr suggested that there
    are energy levels due to physical qualities.
    He claimed that electrons move around the
    nucleus in set orbits and can jump from one
    orbit to another if energy was provided and
    the energy relesed would be given off as
    radiation. In general, Bohr's model is really
    similar to Rutherford's but just with extra
    energy levels.

  <h2>
    Quantum Mechanical Model (Latest Model of The
    Atom)
  </h2>
  <hr class="head" />
  <p class="white">
    The Bohr model does a good job explaining the
    hydrogen atom and its spectral lines however
    later on, when it comes to complex atoms it
    will have some issues explaining spectrolines
    of complex elements and their energy levels.
    So in 1933, Austrian Scientist, Erwin
    Schrodinger used complex quantum mathematical
    equations to propose that electrons do not
    move in perfect rings and instead they travel
    in orbitals/waves and also it does not explain
    were electrons are but instead the percentage
    of it existing there.. There are 4 types of
    orbitals that can combine into composite
    orbitals. S orbital is the simplest orbital,
    then followed by p,d and f which get more
    complicated. These orbitals happen in all 3
    dimensions, xyz. Furthermore, hybridization
    can happen when composite orbitals combine
    together. For example, you have s and p
    combined 4 times then, sp combines 3 time
    creating a hybridization of sp3 into a
    tetrahedral shape. This hybridization can
    happen to any combination of orbitals. These
    orbitals are different for each type of
    element, some elements can have multiple
    orbitals and multiple hybridizations, This
    model also included the idea of sub energy
    levels within these orbitals.
